# OCaml Inlining Reports

This project defines some utilities to handle and manipulate the inlining
reports generated by the `ocamlopt` native compiler.

WARNING: this is still highly experimental


## Build and Installation

### With opam

Since dune generates opam files, this repo can be pinned using opam:

```
opam pin add ocir https://github.com/Gbury/ocir
```

### Manually with dune

Since the project builds with dune, it should be easy to build and install:

```
dune build @install # to build the installable parts
dune install        # to install the lib and binary
```

Or you can also vendor the project.


## Usage

Currently the `ocir` library is composed of two small parts:

- `ocir_core` defines a central notion of inlining report,
  and some printing functions (more to come later).
- `ocir_format` defines converters to read serialized inlining
  reports and convert them to the inlining report type defined
  in `ocir_core`.

Additionally, an `ocir` binary exists. This binary is currently very
limited and simply reads a serialized inlining report and prints it
in human readable format on stdout.
